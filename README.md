# TroshinAnton.github.io

A repository with a site where I publish templates for sports programming from friends. There is no special meaning here. This is for lazy people who don't want to open their profile on Codeforces.

Let's say I decided to solve a couple of problems from a friend's computer in Omsk. My template is not there and I solve not on Codeforces. In this case, I will open this site and take my template.
